- In this example, we first create an OpenCV Mat object by reading an image file using the imread function. Then we create a json object called serializedMat and fill it with the necessary data from the Mat object. Finally, we write the JSON object to a file using the dump function with an indentation of 4 spaces.

- Note that in this example we are only serializing the pixel data of the image (image.data). If your Mat object contains other metadata such as the pixel format, color space, or other properties, you may need to add them to the JSON object as well.
